# LM Workouts

**Fitbit** exercise app that displays the <a href="https://www.lesmills.co.nz/timetable">New Zealand Les Mills</a> group fitness timetable. It also features a workout tracker that logs each workout under the chosen class name (e.g. BODYPUMP, BODYATTACK etc).

  ## Disclaimer:
    This app is NOT officially part of Les Mills New Zealand. I made this app so I can conveniently 
    view the timetable on my watch and also log each exercise under the Les Mills class names.

 ## Note:
    Current this app is only packaged for the Versa 2 at the moment as it is the only physical device 
    I own for testing.
